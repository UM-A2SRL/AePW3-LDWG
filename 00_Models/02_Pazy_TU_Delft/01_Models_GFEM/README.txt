Models with flexible tip rod were provided by Christoph Mertens (TU Delft).

We created variants with rigid tip rod to ease the equivalent beam modeling. The only difference is that the tip rod is treated as a rigid member that stiffens the entire tip cross section. 

Note that the built-up finite element model is without skin but it was tuned at TU Delft based on GVT frequencies of the experimental model with skin.
