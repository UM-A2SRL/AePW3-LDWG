Models with flexible tip rod were provided by Prof. Daniella Raveh (Technion).

Models with rigid tip rod were modified to ease the equivalent beam modeling. The only difference is that the tip rod is treated as a rigid member that stiffens the entire tip cross section. 

Modal results are included for all models as reported in Riso and Cesnik, AIAA SciTech Forum, 2022.

The same modal results are also reported in Riso and Cesnik, Journal of Aircraft, 2022, under revision.
