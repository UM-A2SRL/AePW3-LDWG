Results for the post-flutter analysis of the deformed configuration as reported in Riso and Cesnik, IFASD, 2022. 

All results are based on the new UM/NAST model with spanwise variable aerodynamic coefficient derivatives from the Technion data.

All results are for the case with skin without the tip mass and without weight.

diagram_UM_NAST_aoa_5_w_skin.txt: speed, maximum oscillation amplitude, minimum oscillation amplitude

diagram_UM_NAST_aoa_7_w_skin.txt: speed, maximum oscillation amplitude, minimum oscillation amplitude

The maximum and minimun oscillation amplitude for each speed are obtained at the end of a 10-seconds gust response.

The static equilibrium paths are the same as stored under the folder for the nonlinear flutter results.
