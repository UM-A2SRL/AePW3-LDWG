Deformed configurations given as y coordinate (m), z coordinate (semispan %)

The deformed configurations are obtained for different combinations of AoA and speed with no weight.

Results labeled as UM/NAST are for the beam model coupled with strip theory with spanwise variable aerodynamic coefficient derivatives from the Technion data.

The model is analyzed in the UM/NAST nonlinear static aeroelastic solver.

All the other static aeroelastic results reported in the 2022 IFASD paper are stored under the folder for the 2022 AIAA SciTech Forum paper.
