This repository stores the data associated with U-M publications resulting from the Third Aeroelastic Prediction Workshop Large Deflection Working Group.

## Folders associated with Riso and Cesnik, AIAA SciTech Forum, 2022:

* `01_Models_GFEM`: Built-up finite element models for MSC Nastran  
* `02_Models_Beam`: Equivalent beam inertia and stiffness distributions for UM/NAST 
* `03_Modal_Undeformed`: Modal results in undeformed shape 
* `04_Modal_Gravity`: Modal results in statically deformed shape under self weight 
* `05_Static_Bending`: Static bending results due to a tip mass at the midchord point 
* `06_Static_Torsion`: Static torsion results due to a tip mass behind the trailing egde point 
* `07_Static_Aeroelastic`: Static aeroelastic results for AoA = 5, 7 deg
* `08_Linear_Flutter`: Linear flutter analysis (undeformed shape) 
* `09_Nonlinear_Flutter`: Nonlinear flutter analysis for AoA = 0 -> 7 deg

The built-up finite element models with flexible tip rod were originally provided by Prof. Daniella Raveh (Technion). Variants with rigid tip rod were developed at U-M to ease the equivalent beam modeling.
