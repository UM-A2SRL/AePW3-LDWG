# AePW3-LDWG

This repository stores the data associated with our publications resulting from the Third Aeroelastic Prediction Workshop Large Deflection Working Group.

## Wing models

* `01_Pazy_Technion`: Pazy wing version from Technion (this model is used in the Riso and Cesnik publications)
* `02_Pazy_TU_Delft`: Pazy wing version from TU Delft     

The model folders contain the Nastran GFEMs along with the equivalent beam properties used in our analyses.

The built-up finite element models of the Technion Pazy wing with flexible tip rod were originally provided by Prof. Daniella Raveh (Technion). Variants with rigid tip rod were developed by us to ease the equivalent beam modeling.

The built-up finite element model of the TU Delft Pazy wing with flexible tip rod was originally provided by Christoph Mertens (TU Delft). Again, rigid-tip variants were developed by us to ease the equivalent beam modeling.

Note that the TU Delft Pazy wing Nastran GFEM is without the skin, but its properties are tuned based on the GVT of the Pazy wing model with skin tested at TU Delft. 

## Folders associated with Riso and Cesnik, AIAA SciTech Forum, 2022 (also Riso and Cesnik, Journal of Aircraft, under review):

* `01_Modal_Undeformed`: Modal results in undeformed shape 
* `02_Modal_Gravity`: Modal results in statically deformed shape under self weight 
* `03_Static_Bending`: Static bending results due to a tip mass at the midchord point 
* `04_Static_Torsion`: Static torsion results due to a tip mass behind the trailing egde point 
* `05_Static_Aeroelastic`: Static aeroelastic results for AoA = 5, 7 deg
* `06_Linear_Flutter`: Linear flutter analysis (undeformed shape) 
* `07_Nonlinear_Flutter`: Nonlinear flutter analysis for AoA = 0 -> 7 deg

## Folders associated with Riso and Cesnik, IFASD, 2022:

* `01_Static_Aeroelastic`: Static aeroelastic results for AoA = 5, 7 deg
* `02_Linear_Flutter`: Linear flutter analysis (undeformed shape) 
* `03_Nonlinear_Flutter`: Nonlinear flutter analysis for AoA = 0 -> 7 deg
