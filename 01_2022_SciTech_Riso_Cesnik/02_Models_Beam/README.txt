Equivalent beam inertia properties and stiffness properties are given with respect to the beam reference axis at 44% of the chord. 

The coordinates of the beam reference axis nodes are given in coordinates.txt in the MSC Nastran frame but with origin at the wing root. This is not exactly the origin of the MSC Nastran frame in the GFEM because of a small offset.

The equivalent inertia properties are given per beam node. All values are in the MSC Nastran frame. 

Values in a given column are for different beam nodes ("keypoints) root to tip. The meaning of each label is consistent with MSC Nastran CONM2 cards.

mass = rigid-body mass

cgx = rigid-body offset from the node along x
cgy = rigid-body offset from the node along y
cgz = rigid-body offset from the node along z

Ixx = rigid-body xx inertia matrix element about the local C.G. (node position plus offset) 
Iyy = rigid-body yy inertia matrix element about the local C.G. (node position plus offset) 
Izz = rigid-body zz inertia matrix element about the local C.G. (node position plus offset) 
Ixy = rigid-body xy inertia matrix element about the local C.G. (node position plus offset) 
Ixz = rigid-body xz inertia matrix element about the local C.G. (node position plus offset) 
Iyz = rigid-body yz inertia matrix element about the local C.G. (node position plus offset) 

These properties do not include the additional trailing-edge mass that was included in some of the results (static bending, static torsion, and flutter results). 
That can be added as an extra concentrated mass with an offset from the trailing-edge node.

Equivalent stiffness properties are given per beam element and they have meaning in the local frame attached to each element. 

Values in a given column are for different beam elements root to tip. The meaning of each label is consistent with the geometrically exact strain-based formulation of Su and Cesnik.

K11 = axial stiffness
K22 = torsion stiffness
K33 = out-of-plane bending stifness
K44 = in-plane bending stiffness

K12 = axial-torsion coupling
K13 = axial-out-of-plane bending coupling
K14 = axial-in-plane bending coupling

K23 = torsion-out-of-plane bending coupling
K24 = torsion-in-plane bending coupling

K34 - out-of-plane-in-plane-bending coupling

For details about how these properties were obtained, see Riso and Cesnik, AIAA SciTech Forum, 2021 & 2022. 

Plots of the properties are given in Appendix of Riso and Cesnik, AIAA SciTech Forum, 2022 and Riso and Cesnik, Journal of Aircraft, 2022, under revision.

The properties are also available for download from the AePW3-LDWG website.

The publications Riso and Cesnik, AIAA SciTech Forum, 2022 and Riso and Cesnik, Journal of Aircraft, 2022, under revision contain additional cases of beam properties obtained using different condensation parameters.
These cases were considered during a sensitivity study that led to the final beam properties reported here. We have not added the intermediate properties and related modal results to the repository, but we can provide them upon request.
