Tip vertical displacement given as flow speed (m/s), z displacement (semispan %)

The flow speed varies for fixed angle of attack without weight.

Results labeled as UM/NAST are for the beam model coupled with strip theory with tip loss factors analyzed in the UM/NAST static aeroelastic solver.

Results labeles as UM/NAST-VLM are for the beam model coupled with the VLM analyzed in the UM/NAST static aeroelastic solver with VLM interface.

Results labeled as GFEM are from the MSC Nastran finite element model with rigid tip rod analyzed in SOL 400 or SOL 144 (linear).

In SOL 144, the aerodynamic loads are given by the VLM. In SOL 400, the aerodynamic loads are frozen loads from the converged UM/NAST-VLM solution.

SOL 400 results are given only for the case without skin because the finite element model with skin does not run.
