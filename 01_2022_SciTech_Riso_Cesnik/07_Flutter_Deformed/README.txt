Results for the nonlinear flutter analysis of the deformed configuration as reported in Riso and Cesnik, AIAA SciTech Forum, 2022. 

All results are based on the UM/NAST model with tip loss factor tuned based on the UM/NAST-VLM model.

All results are for the case with skin without the tip mass and without weight.
