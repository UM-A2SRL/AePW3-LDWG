Deformed configurations given as y coordinate (m), z coordinate (semispan %)

The four conditions correspond to tip masses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kg (located 0.04 m behind the tip trailing edge)

Results labeled as UM/NAST are for the beam model analyzed in the UM/NAST nonlinear static solver.

Results labeled as GFEM are from the MSC Nastran finite element model with rigid tip rod analyzed in SOL 400.

Results are given only for the case without skin because the finite element model with skin does not run in SOL 400.
