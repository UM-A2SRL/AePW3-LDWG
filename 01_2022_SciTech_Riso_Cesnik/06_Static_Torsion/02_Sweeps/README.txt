Tip vertical displacement given as tip mass (kg), z displacement (semispan %) or tip mass (kg), twist rotation (deg)

The twist rotation is recovered from the differential displacement of the tip leading and trailing edges.

The tip mass varies from 0 to 3.5 kg and is positioned 0.04 m behind the trailing edge (in the case without skin) and 0.08 m behind the trailing egde (in the case with skin).

Results labeled as UM/NAST are for the beam model analyzed in the UM/NAST nonlinear static solver.

Results labeled as GFEM are from the MSC Nastran finite element model with rigid tip rod analyzed in SOL 400 or SOL 101 (linear).

SOL 400 results are given only for the case without skin because the finite element model with skin does not run.

All displacements and rotations are given by subtracting the initial offset due to the self-weight for better comparison.
