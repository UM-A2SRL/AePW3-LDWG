Models with flexible tip rod were provided by Prof. Daniella Raveh (Technion).

Models with rigid tip rod were modified at U-M to ease the equivalent beam modeling. The only difference is that the tip rod is treated as a rigid member connected to the main wing root. 

Modal results are included for all models as reported in Riso and Cesnik, AIAA SciTech Forum, 2022.
