Tip vertical displacement given as tip mass (kg), z displacement (semispan %)

The tip mass varies from 0 to 3.5 kg and is positioned at the tip midchord.

Results labeled as UM/NAST are for the beam model analyzed in the UM/NAST nonlinear static solver.

Results labeled as GFEM are from the MSC Nastran finite element model with rigid tip rod analyzed in SOL 400 or SOL 101 (linear).

SOL 400 results are given only for the case without skin because the finite element model with skin does not run.

All displacements are given by subtracting the initial offset due to the self-weight for better comparison.
