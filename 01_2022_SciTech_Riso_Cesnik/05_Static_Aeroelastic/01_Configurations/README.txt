Deformed configurations given as y coordinate (m), z coordinate (semispan %)

The deformed configurations are obtained for different combinations of AoA and speed with no weight.

Results labeled as UM/NAST are for the beam model coupled with strip theory and tip loss factors analyzed in the UM/NAST nonlinear static aeroelastic solver.

Results labeled as UM/NAST-UVLM are for the beam model coupled with the VLM analyzed in the UM/NAST nonlinear static aeroelastic solver with VLM interface.

Results labeled as GFEM are from the MSC Nastran finite element model with rigid tip rod analyzed in SOL 400 or SOL 144 (linear).

The aerodynamics in the SOL 144 results is given by the DLM. The aerodynamics in the SOL 400 results is given by frozen UM/NAST-VLM converged loads.

Nonlinear results for the GFEM are given only for the case without skin because the finite element model with skin does not run in SOL 400.
