The folders contain the results from the built-up finite element model and UM/NAST.

The GVT are reported by Avin et. al, AIAA Journal, 2022, and specific references to their Tables are included in our paper.

All frequencies are given in Hz. 

The mode shapes contained in the folder 06_Beam_Final list the main displacement component as a function of the coordinate along the wing span.

Mode 1: vertical displacement
Mode 2: vertical displacement
Mode 3: twist angle
Mode 4: vertical displacement
Mode 5: in-plane displacement

The results for the GFEM are obtained by recovering the displacements of the beam reference axis using the same RBE3s as for obtaining the stiffness properties.
