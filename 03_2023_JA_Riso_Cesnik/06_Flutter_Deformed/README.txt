The results are from UM/NAST only and they are all for the Pazy wing model without skin and without the tip mass, focusing on the instability region of the hump mode.

The results are in the form of flutter onset and offset speeds and flutter onset frequencies.

The comparison table shows the flutter onset speed comparison between UM/NAST and the experimental data (onset up and down sweeps), and the same comparison for the flutter frequency (onset up only).

The files show the flutter onset and offset speeds as functions of the root angle of attack (deg) or the wingtip vertical deflection (% semispan).

Additional files show the static equilibrium path of the wingtip vertical deflection (% semispan) as a function of the flow speed at select root angles of attack. 

All flutter speeds are in m/s and all flutter frequencies are in Hz. 


No GFEM results are available for this case.

The experimental results are reported by Drachinsky and Raveh, AIAA Journal, 2022.

Note that we were not involved in the experiments. If you have questions about the experimental data, please reach out to Prof. Daniella Raveh (Technion).
