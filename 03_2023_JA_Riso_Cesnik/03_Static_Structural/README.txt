The folders contain the results from the built-up finite element model and UM/NAST.

The results are in the form of deformed configurations and tip sweeps.

The deformed configuration files list the spanwise and vertical positions in the columns (in this order). Vertical positions are given in % semispan.

In the bending case, the sweep files list the tip mass, vertical displacement, and axial displacement in the columns (in this order). Both displacement components are given in % semispan.

In the torsion cases, there are displacement and rotation sweep files. 

The displacement sweep files list the tip mass, vertical displacement, axial displacement, and in-plane displacements in the columns (in this order). Displacement components are given in % semispan.

The rotation sweep files list the tip mass and the twist angle in the columns. Twist angles are given in deg.


The results for the GFEM are obtained by recovering the displacements of the beam reference axis using the same RBE3s as for obtaining the stiffness properties. Twist angles are recovered from the differential LE and TE positions.


The experimental data are from the Technion tests and only include sweep results for the tip vertical displacement and twist angle (for torsion only). 


For further details on the numerical results, see Riso and Cesnik, AIAA SciTech Forum, 2022 and Journal of Aircraft, 2023.

The experimental results are reported by Avin et. al, AIAA Journal, 2022, and specific references to their Tables are included in our paper.

Note that we were not involved in the experiments. If you have questions about the experimental data, please reach out to Prof. Daniella Raveh (Technion).
