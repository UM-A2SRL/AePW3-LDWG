Deformed configurations given as y coordinate (m), z coordinate (semispan %)

The deformed configurations are obtained for different combinations of AoA and speed with no weight.

Results are for the beam model coupled with strip theory with spanwise variable aerodynamic coefficient derivatives from the Technion data.

The model is analyzed in the UM/NAST considering different geometrically nonlinear effects, for instance

static_aeroelastic_aoa5_U30_UM_NAST = nonlinear kinematics and follower aerodynamics

static_aeroelastic_aoa5_U30_UM_NAST_nf = nonlinear kinematics and nonfollower aerodynamics

static_aeroelastic_aoa5_U30_UM_NAST_lin = linear kinematics and follower aerodynamics

static_aeroelastic_aoa5_U30_UM_NAST_lin_nf = linear kinematics and nonfollower aerodynamics

All the other static aeroelastic results reported in Riso and Cesnik, Journal of Aircraft, 2023 are in that folder.
