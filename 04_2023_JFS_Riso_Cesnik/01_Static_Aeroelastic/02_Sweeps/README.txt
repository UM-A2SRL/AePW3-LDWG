Tip displacements and twist given as flow speed (m/s), z displacement (semispan %), y displacement (semispan %), x displacement (semispan %), twist (deg)

The flow speed varies for fixed angle of attack without weight.

Results labeled as UM/NAST are for the beam model coupled with strip theory with spanwise variable aerodynamic coefficient derivatives from the Technion data.

The model is analyzed in the UM/NAST considering different geometrically nonlinear effects, for instance

static_aeroelastic_aoa5_UM_NAST_sweep = nonlinear kinematics and follower aerodynamics

static_aeroelastic_aoa5_UM_NAST_sweep_nf = nonlinear kinematics and nonfollower aerodynamics

static_aeroelastic_aoa5_UM_NAST_sweep_lin = linear kinematics and follower aerodynamics

static_aeroelastic_aoa5_UM_NAST_sweep_lin_nf = linear kinematics and nonfollower aerodynamics

All the other static aeroelastic results reported in Riso and Cesnik, Journal of Aircraft, 2023 are in that folder.
