The results are from UM/NAST only and they are all for the Pazy wing model without skin and without the tip mass, focusing on the instability region of the hump mode.

The results are in the form of maximum and minimum amplitudes of LCOs for the tip vertical displacement at the half chord point.

The files show the flow speed (m/s), maximum LCO amplitude (% semispan), and minimum LCO amplitude (% semispan). 

Additional files showing the static equilibrium path are in the folder for the flutter results in deformed shape. 

The results are obtained by coupling the beam model with strip theory with spanwise variable aerodynamic properties and are, for instance

LCO_skin1_tipmass0_aoa5 = nonlinear kinematics and follower aerodynamics

LCO_skin1_tipmass0_aoa5_nf = nonlinear kinematics and nonfollower aerodynamics

The same convention applies to other output files.


No GFEM results are available for this case.
