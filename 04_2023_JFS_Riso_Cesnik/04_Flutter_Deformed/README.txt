The results are from UM/NAST only and they are all for the Pazy wing model without skin and without the tip mass, focusing on the instability region of the hump mode.

The results are in the form of flutter onset and offset speeds and flutter onset frequencies.

The files show the flutter onset and offset speeds (m/s) as functions of the root angle of attack (deg) or the wingtip vertical deflection (% semispan).

Additional files show the static equilibrium path of the wingtip vertical deflection (% semispan) as a function of the flow speed at select root angles of attack. 

The results labeled as tip loss are obtained by coupling the beam model with strip theory with tip loss correction and are fully nonlinear (nonlinear kinematics and follower aerodynamics).

The other results are obtained by coupling the beam model with strip theory with spanwise variable aerodynamic properties and are, for instance

flutter_deformed_skin1_tipmass0_onset_vs_aoa = nonlinear kinematics and follower aerodynamics

flutter_deformed_skin1_tipmass0_onset_vs_aoa_nf = nonlinear kinematics and nonfollower aerodynamics

The same convention applies to other output files.


No GFEM results are available for this case.
