The file aero_coeff.txt contains the aerodynamic coefficient derivatives used for all the aeroelastic results, given as

spanwise position from the wing root, lift curve slope, quarter-chord pitching moment curve slope

The values of the aerodynamic coefficient derivatives are set to zero at the wing tip

The drag aerodynamic coefficient derivative is set to zero at each spanwise location
