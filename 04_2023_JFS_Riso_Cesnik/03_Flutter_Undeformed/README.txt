Evolution of the three plotted eigenvalues in Fig. 12 of Riso and Cesnik, Journal of Fluids and Structures, 2023.

Results given as flow speed (m/s), freq 1 (Hz), damp 1 (rad/s), freq 2 (Hz), damp 2 (rad/s), freq 3 (Hz), damp 3 (rad/s)

Results labeled as UM/NAST are for the beam model coupled with strip theory with spanwise variable aerodynamic coefficient derivatives from the Technion data.

Results labeled as UM/NAST tiploss are for the beam model coupled with strip theory with tip loss correction as computed in Riso and Cesnik, Journal of Aircraft, 2022.

For the instability points in undeformed shape, see Riso and Cesnik, Journal of Fluids and Structures, 2023.
